# INTRODUCTION
<p align="justify">
Nowadays, film photography faces several challenges. film and camera prices (still rising), expensive development fees and very outdated film scanning methods are some of them. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Let's go step by step, in my opinion, the expenses of film photography, compared to digital photography, for someone who starts from nothing are barely justifiable. 
It is also true that the initial inversion to start on film photography may be lower, as an example: it is possible to buy a Canon AE-1 with a nifty fifty for peaunuts if you're lucky which is nothing compared to the hundreds of euros that must  be invested for a digital one. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
But hey, the initial inversion of film photography is just the start. There are other expenses which I enumerate in the following lines that are, a "collateral damage".
</p>
<p align="justify">
* __Film__ - In the latest years, shooting film has became something next to a luxury. It is true that some films like Fuji C200 or Colorplus 200 are yours for less than 5€ per 36 exposure roll, but what if you want to try Acros 100 II, prepare around 12€ for 36 frames. The same happens for other colour films like Portra, or even worst for slide film reaching 20€ for a roll of Velvia.
</p>
<p align="justify">
* __Film Development__ - In Spain, where I live, it is fairly easy and "inexpensive" to have your film developed (if it is a color film and not medium format). In my case, my lab of trust, charges around 10€ for color development plus copies (10x15). If the film of your choice is B&W I'd say that it is around 20€ for development plus copies.
</p>
<p align="justify">
* __Film Scanning__ - Having your film scanned at the lab is the best option if you want the highest quality, but prepare your wallet because it will cost an average of 25€ per roll. On the other hand. It is possible to do your own film scanning. There exists several ways, the cheapest one is by using a light table and a smartphone, it is also possible to do it in a more professional way, with a DSLR or mirrorless camera and a Macro lens. If on the other hand you want to go on the easiest way, invest in a flatbed scanner.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Since I have tried all the previous methods, I am in the position to perform a comparison between the three them. In the following lines we will delve into them. 
</p>

## METHOD 1. SMARTPHONE SCANNING
---
<p align="justify">
When I started in the film world, I did not have any flatbed scanner or any other source for scanning my negatives. But I was not willing to pay the amounts the labs were to charge me for doing me the job. Either I could find an easy, reliable and cheap way of scanning my negatives or I would've ended quiting analog photography and return again to the digital world.
</p>
<p align="justify">
I had my first roll of B&W film developed in Padrón (A Coruña, Galicia. Spain) back in 2015. I did not have the roll scanned (because of the price), but I asked for the copies. When I went for it, I was very upset, I could see that all the photos where underexposed, it was very frustrating and I took a long time for me to shoot film again. But when I did, I challenged myself to develop and scann it by myself, keeping the costs low.
</p>
<p align="justify">
What did I do? I started to develop all the rools by myself, I found it very rewarding and interesting, on the other hand I saved so much money and made film photography look more appearing to me. The first roll I developed, I just scanned it by means of a dedicated App and a Smartphone. Not the best way, but at least I could see the pictures.
</p>
<br/><br/>

### METHOD EXPENSES
<p align="justify">
Barely none, nowadays everybody's got a Smartphone, so let's just say that in this case, the only thing you need is a dedicated App. If you only shoot B&W, then it is very simple, since the free app Snapseed will be more that enough for you. If you also shoot color, then you will need a dedicated App.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Photo Negative Scanner is one of the film scanning apps (for both B&W and colour negatives) available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.appdictive.colorNegativeViewer&hl=en_US&gl=US), there may be others for IOS, just make a quick search at Apple Store. 
Since the scope of this post is to compare DSLR / mirrorless scanning vs flatbed scanning. I will not go very deep on Smartphone scanning, just introduce it, and let you know that it is possible to do it (with its limitations). 
</p>
<br/><br/>

### MATERIAL NEEDED
<p align="justify">
Smartphone scanning, performed with no other tools; like a film holder, light table or such accesories has a lot of limitations. You will need to search for a light source, as difuse as possible, on the other hand, negatives wont usually stay flat by its own, so you will have lots of perspective issues. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
It is of course possible to scan negatives this way, nevertheless is not the one I recommend, unless you don't care about the perspective issues or bas quality results. if you only want it as a preview tool for enlarging the negatives.
</p>
<br/><br/>

### NECESSARY SKILLS
<p align="justify">
Even my grandparent would be able to scan negatives this way. The App does everything, and guides you through the entire process.
</p>
<br/><br/>

### PROCESSING TIME
<p align="justify">
It does not take too much, but it hughly depends on the tools you may have, if you, for example, own a [Lomography Smartphone Scanner](https://shop.lomography.com/en/smartphone-scanner?country=es), it obviously faster, but obviously it comes at a price of 69€ + delivery fees.
</p>
<br/><br/>

### END RESULT
<p align="justify">
Ok. Let's go to the results, this tests have been performed procesing the photos shot with a Sony A6000 and vintage Tamron Macro Lens, also I put the film through my film holder (3D-printed). 
</p>
<p align="justify">
In the end, this test will only evaluate the APP capabilites. Take into account that the results will worsen if the photos are performed with a Smartphone.
</p>
<p align="justify">
In essence, Smartphone scanning is a tool which is only acceptable for preview purposes. Sometimes I have used it to takr a quick look at the results while the roll is still hanged drying (the app allows for live preview). The examples seen bellow, as previously noted, are pictures shot with a Sony A6000 + negative holder (3D-Printed), highlighted with a simple room led panel (20W), and converted with the Photo Negative Scanner application. Another fact to be noted is that this application does not give the option to perform a horizontal flip of the image (something essential when DSLR scanning).
</p>
<br/><br/>

## METHOD 2. FLATBED SCANNING
---
<p align="justify">
As previously described on Method 1. Smartphone Scanning. *Either I could find an easy, reliable and cheap way of scanning my negatives or I would've ended quiting analog photography.* 
</p>
<p align="justify">
The reliable and "cheap" way that I could find was to use a flatbed scanner. I made a quick search and found a cheap CanonScan 9000F Mark II, which promised pretty much better results than Smartphone scanning. I can not remember how nuch it was, but I have to say it was well spent money.
</p>
<p align="justify">
This scanning method is the one I've been using since 2015 with great success. Let's just go through with the analysis.
</p>
<br/><br/>

### METHOD EXPENSES
<p align="justify">
Flatbed scanning is one the cheapest, in terms of "price vs quality", ways of scanning your own film at home. Nevertheless you'll obviously need a flatbed scanner. There are two brands that I know which make flatbed scanners for film: Epson and Canon. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Epson has got a wide variety in terms of price and quality, they go from 270€ for the [Epson V600](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B002QFA4IU?tag=amz-mkt-chr-es-21&ascsubtag=1ba00-01000-org00-win10-other-nomod-es000-pcomp-feature-rscomp-wm-5&ref=aa_rscomp), to 800€ for the proffesional [Epson V850](https://www.amazon.es/Epson-Perfection-V850-Pro-fotogr%C3%A1fico/dp/B00NVA77PM/ref=pd_sbs_147_7?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00NVA77PM&pd_rd_r=0f696cae-2389-471e-b5dd-155046f8c4d3&pd_rd_w=x4EcL&pd_rd_wg=MbuN2&pf_rd_p=67f01a2a-b609-4166-a4fd-4c54d5e0c873&pf_rd_r=YP509A1SSFM34DMAJQJC&psc=1&refRID=YP509A1SSFM34DMAJQJC).
</p>
<p align="justify">
If you're a newbie, I would encourage you to buy the V600, it has great quality for the price, more than enough for sharing pictures in social media. The good thing about flatbed scanners is that they usually allow to scan both 35mm film and medium format. If you never shoot medium format (you should try), then may be I would rather recommend a [Plustek 8100](https://www.amazon.es/Epson-Perfection-V850-Pro-fotogr%C3%A1fico/dp/B00NVA77PM/ref=pd_sbs_147_7?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00NVA77PM&pd_rd_r=0f696cae-2389-471e-b5dd-155046f8c4d3&pd_rd_w=x4EcL&pd_rd_wg=MbuN2&pf_rd_p=67f01a2a-b609-4166-a4fd-4c54d5e0c873&pf_rd_r=YP509A1SSFM34DMAJQJC&psc=1&refRID=YP509A1SSFM34DMAJQJC) dedicated 35mm scanner for both, better quality at the same price range of flatbed scanners, and also a smaller form factor.
</p>
<p align="justify">
I own myself a Canoscan 9000F Mark II, but searching on the internet, I think that it has been recently discontinued, since I can not find at a low price, in fact, the only ones that I find on ebay (second hand) are way over 300€, which I think that is something over the top, since it is not that great product. Anyway, try to search on second hand local applications, for example in Spain we have *Wallapop* I founded there for close to 100€, which is a normal price for that scanner.
</p>
<br/><br/>

### MATERIAL NEEDED
<p align="justify">
Evidently, you will need a negative scanner, either a flatbed or a dedicated 35mm one. Of course you will also need a computer, it is not necessary to have a very powerful one, the application I think runs on very low specifications. It is also recommended to have a air blower, since the negatives when drying tend to acquire te dust present in the air.
</p>
<br/><br/>

### NECESSARY SKILLS
<p align="justify">
More or less the same as with SmartPhone Scanning. Obviously, the application gives more configurability and if you have the skills you`ll be able to modify many settings that may improve your scans, but nevertheless for a normal JPEG image you won't need any advanced skills.
</p>
<br/><br/>

### PROCESSING TIME
<p align="justify">
Processing time hugely depends on the quality of the output scans evidently if you want them to be 9000 ppi then it will take mostly 30' per 12 pictures. If you just want it 2400 it will barely take around 10'. If you do it just for preview, like I do, then the 12 frames will take less than 10'.
</p>
<br/><br/>

### END RESULT
<p align="justify">
In this regarding, I am gonig to talk about my experience with the CanoScan 9000F Mark II, but I guess that the Epson family works in a similar way. The results given by the flatbed scanner are, in my opinion, fine, but not perfect. The following pictures are shown like they come out from the scanner. No compression or edition has been applied by the Canon SW. The program used for this task is Canon ScanGear.
</p>
<br/><br/>

## METHOD 3. DSLR / MIRRORLESS SCANNING
---
<p align="justify">
Althoug I have the flatbed scanner. Recently, many of the film related youtubers that I follow, have dedicated youtube videos to *Film scanning with a digital camera*, so during lockdown I thought I had time to give it a chance. I was developing lots of film and thougt it was a good time.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Apparently the output quality is outstanding compared to user-end flatbed scanners, even better compared to dedicated lab scanners (Noritsu, frontier or pakon), which are selling for 1500 - 3000€ (which are much bulkier and need a dedicated *old* PC with XP Windows).
</p>
<br/><br/>

### METHOD EXPENSES AND NEEDED MATERIAL
<p align="justify">
I could say that barely none, but not everybody has a DSLR or a mirrorless camera with a macro lens. In a perfect world where the money grew on trees, you would need:
</p>

* Mirroless or DSLR camera (with HDMI output)
* Dedicated macro lens
* Light table
* TV or monitor with HDMI interface
* Remote shutter

<p align="justify">
In my case, I already had laying around a Nikon D7100 (DSLR) and a Sony A6000 (Mirrorless). As you can imagine, I got the Sony because it was possible to use all the vintage lenses that I had easily. In the other hand, I did not have a macro lens, so I had to buy one, I went on the cheap side with a vintage Tamron Adaptall 35 - 80 for Canon FD mount.
</p>
<p align="justify">
I also bought a drawing light table, do not make the same mistake, Drawing light tables are not powerful enough for ensuring not very slow shutter speeds on low ISO. So, do not waste your money on them. Some people recommends kaiser light tables, but in my opinion they are very expensive and look pretty similar to the drawing ones (don't expect it to be very bright).
</p>
<p align="justify">
I then ended up buying a LED light panel, those you can find at Leroy Merlin, Home Depot or similar stores. I bought it on amazon (*remember, Lockdown*). I ended up buying a 220 x 220 mm square LED panel, 20 W and 2000 Lumen of light intensity (a bit over the top, 1000 lumen will be more than enough). For you to make an idea on how bright it is. The panel with its own diffuser plus another 3mm white diffuser I add, plus the negative gives an exposure setting of: **ISO 100, F8.0, 1/100 - 1/200**. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Speaking about the monitor, firstly, it is not a must, it only helps on the focus task. Any one should work, just make sure that it is possible to connect your camera to it (usually HDMI interface). Remote shutter isn't essential aswell, but it helps to avoid trepidation of the camera when hitting the shutter. It makes the process faster and easier. On the other hand, you can always use the timer function on your camera (like I do).
