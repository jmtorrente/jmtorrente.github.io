# ND MIATA AIRBAG (AWFUL) ACTIVATION LIGHT

Let's be syncere, whatever car you buy, it will have something you may not like at all. In my case, back in 2017 I bought a mx5 nd, 2.0 160 bhp version. It had been my (affrodable) dream car for a long time. One of the things that I do not really like is that the center console has that airbag state light, which in my opinion does not fit with the car. I have never seen this in my life in any other car, at least in this way. 

Watching miata forums on the web, I could see that some people were making some DIY projects, In fact, I have seen some people that have the same as me. I do not know who had the idea first, but anyhow this is my approach, with a 3D printer, CAD software ana little imagination you can do everything I did and you will be amazed with the result.
