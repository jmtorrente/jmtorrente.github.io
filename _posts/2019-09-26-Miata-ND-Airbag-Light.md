# ND MIATA AIRBAG (AWFUL) ACTIVATION LIGHT

Let's be syncere, whatever car you buy, it will have something you may not like at all. In my case, back in 2017 I bought a mx5 nd, 2.0 160 bhp version. It had been my (affrodable) dream car for a long time. One of the things that I do not really like is that the center console has that airbag state light, which in my opinion does not fit with the car. I have never seen this in my life in any other car, at least in this way. 
<br/><br/>
Watching miata forums on the web, I could see that some people were making some DIY projects, In fact, I have seen some people that have the same as me. I do not know who had the idea first, but anyhow this is my approach, with a 3D printer, CAD software ana little imagination you can do everything I did and you will be amazed with the result.

As it can be seen. it is not the most beautiful gadget to have in your car. and so I started to think on how to tweak it in order to make it look better than it actually does. I finally made the decissión of removing the piece and see how the piece was made to figure out if I could make a more beautiful shape whit my 3D printer (A very cheap, but very good Crealty Ender 3).
<br/><br/>

With Solid edge CAD software I created a beautiful pattern to substitute the original one. The OEM piece is made by two: a bigg plastic piece which holds a this plastic layer in which the light-up symbols are engraved. My first design was a two piece design and between both a three layer of onionskin paper. The result does not look as premium as the OEM one, but in the end it does its function and when mounted does look that bad.

## IMPROVEMENTS
<br/><br/>
Evidently this is the first prototype of the product, some of the major issues found are the following:
<br/><br/>
1. The best printed surface is that in contact with the heatbed. in this case, due to the small rails in the lower part of it. It is important to print it knowing this issue and so invert the piece 180º in order for it to be printed in the best way, because the rails are not symetric.
2. The onionskin paper is a shabby solution. A better one should be studied in order for better end-quality.
3. The upper holes are a little tight, size must be enlarged a little for better fit.
4. It is highly possible that I did not make the selection for generate support material, because it built none.
5. It is also possible to create a kind of pins to adjust the front panel to the piece for better alignment. If the second point is solved, then this is pointless, since the piece will be entirely printed in one piece.
<br/><br/>

## CONCLUSIONS
<br/><br/>
As a conclusion, the quality, if the issues are solved, it will be pretty good. In the darkness it is very difficult to notice the bad quality, even in the first prototype made. The car shape is lits up very good and it can be seen very good.

There is one thing which could be improved: one of the leds is orange. It remains orange as long as nobody seats in passenger seat (in that case, it turns off), If it is orange, it creates a strange degraded effect which starts or ends in orange. This could be solved just by replacing those leds for other with different color.
