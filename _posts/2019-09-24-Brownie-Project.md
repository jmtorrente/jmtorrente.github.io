# BROWNIE IQ PROJECT:

The scope of this project is to be able to gain some control over old cameras like the Kodak Brownie Flash II. Kodak Brownie II is a very cheap and simple film camera with a fixed focal lens, fix focus, fixed F number and only one shutter speed. 
<br/><br/>
Let's got over the main characteristics of this camera:
<br/><br/>
* Lens: 1 + 1 element fixed focus (with a second lens for close-ups).
* Focal Length: Supposely around 100mm.
* Shutter speed: 1/50th of a second. Bulb mode available.
* Aperture: Fix aperture F11.
* Film: 620 film (it is possible to fit 120 forcing a little).
<br/><br/>
There is not focus feedback and the photo is composed by means of two small mirrors. for vertical and horizontal composition.

## FIRST APPROACH

The first approach is also the most complex one. It includes the use of an electromagnetic shutter. It is not easy to get the right electromagnetic shutter, and so, it will be necessary to do some investigation. Aliexpress sells some small versions  which may be useful, at least for tests, but there is no datasheet and no information about fastest opssible speed or such. It is cheap, but anyway a blind bought.

## SECOND APPROACH

the second approach is a bit less optimistic. If the first approach does not work (and anyway), we will try to couple an old camera shutter to the Brownie. This seems not to be very difficult. I have tried with my old Kodak Junior Autograph NÂº1 Wollensak Optical shutter not dettaching the Brownie one, and I think, that even though there seemed to be a little vignette.
<br/><br/>
I guess that if I detached the current lens of the Kodak Brownie, I could better test if it actually create some vignetting on the negative. Puting both cameras side by side I can say that it should be fine.
<br/><br/>
The problem of this second approach is that we won't have any focus. Brownie lens is a fixed focus lens with a detachable close up pictures lens. On the other hand, Kodak Junior lens is not fix focus, it does have a small movement which allows it to move
