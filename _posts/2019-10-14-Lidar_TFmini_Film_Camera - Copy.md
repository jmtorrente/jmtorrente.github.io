# ARDUINO-BASED SYTEM FOR FOCUS DISTANCE ESTIMATION
<p align="justify">
</p>
Why would anybody need a focus distance estimation nowadays! I mean every camera even those in our mobile phones have advanced and highly accurate focus systems that do not fail very often. So what is the end of this post.

Well, I'm a huge fan of analog photography (the title of the Blog clearly states that.... ;-)), and I suffer from GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome), I cannot resist the temptation of buying old cameras. I restore them and I use them, needless to say that I develope my own film and scan all the negatives in a dedicated flatbed scanner. I can also make positives out of these negatives with a meopta enlarger in my darkroom. But that is all  another matter which we may deal in the future.


For this project, it is necessary to check the following links, and after that create the post:
