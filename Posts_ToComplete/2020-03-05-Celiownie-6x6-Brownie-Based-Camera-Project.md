# CAMERA BUILD OBJECTIVES

Since my girlfriend gave me a Kodak Brownie Flash II, I have been thinking on how I could make that camera better. I love the simiplicity it has, but some times, it is a bit frustrating not to be able to choose shutter speed or focus. As you may know, most (if not all) cameras are:

* Fix focus
* Fix F number
* Fix shutter speed

I wanted to improve that desing by attaching a normal Brownie camera another leaf shutter lens, but in the end, I found out easier to made my own body specifically for the lens I would bought.

## PROJECT MAIN OBJECTIVES

* Create an affordable Brownie-type camera
* It must be made out of 3D printed parts
* All the parts must be designed and 3D printed in home for lower expenses (all but the lens)
* Picture quality must be high 
* Operability must be easy and intuitive
* Lens must include a shutter leaf
* Lens must include focus hellicoid - easier design

## PROJECT STAGES

* Preliminary design (sketch) 
* Buy shutter leaf lens
* CAD design of camera components
* 3D-Printing parts and correction of issues
* Check infinity focus
* Maiden film test
* Film development to search for possible leaks
* Future iterations

### PRELIMINARY DESIGN (SKETCH)

Preliminary design was performed on a sheet and based on other wide format cameras, such as Pinholes and Kodak Brownie. Evidently it is just a sketch of what could be, when the CAD design process starts, the design will be modified affected mainly to make it printable.

This is the first 120 format camera I've made. Brownie-based that I ended up calling "Celiwonie". I made it for my girlfriend, whose name is Celia, and hence the name of the camera. The only difference with the common Brownie is that in this case, this is not a 6x9 format, but 6x6. 

Bellow it is possible to see some pictures of the design I made using Solid Edge CAD programming software. 

### SELCTED LENS

Selecting the proper lens is not an easy task. A lot of things must be taken into account. For example, focal length, top shutter speed, max F-Number and of course glass quality, in my project I also needed the focus hellicoid built-in the lens body. This would make the design much simpler in termns of CAD, becasuse there would be no need to design a 3D-Printed hellicoid.

Since I did not want to spend a large amount of money, I started looking for medium format 6x6 and 6x9 cameras, I did not care about the cosmetic state of the camera itself, since I only wanted the lens, I did not even care if the camera was working, I only wanted the shutter. This is how I found the camera I ended up buying, a Zeiss-Ikkon Nettar, with a 75mm F8 lens.

This is not the best lens in the world, but in my opinion is pretty sharp and contrasty for its price and size. Main characteristics may be seen in table attached below for your own information.
