# ROLL OF FILM WITH A ZORKI 1

I got my Zorki 1 in october 2019 when I was digging into ebay and found this one, it was sold by a russian ebay seller, I contacted him and asked if it was ok, he told me that the camera could be cocked and it actully fired, but he had not tested the speeds, neither if the lenes had fungus or haze.

Anyhow, for the price, I could take the risk. I'm a film camera collector and so, I am always searching for new cameras to fill my "Billy" shelves (yes, the one from Ikea). I found about Zorki several years ago whn I almost buy a neat Zorki 4K sold in UK. I like the rangefinder setup and wanted to try a Leica II copy.

This camera came with the collapsable Industar 22, with a focal length of 50mm and a widest aperture of F3.5, in your hands, this camera feels very sturdy. It is small in size and fits easily in your palm. It is also heavy for the size. the collapsable lens helps the camera to appear smaller.

Lens collapsable mechanism is actuated by turning the lens counter clockwise and then extracting it, in order to fix it, half a turn in clockwise direction will secure the mechanism. When using it I have had no issues with itm it has not collapsed itself accidentally or any similar issues.

shooting any soviet film camera is a total experience, you have to consider many facts in rorder to not to break the camera. Shutter cocking is made by turning top left knob clockwise, after that you may choose the shutter speed, the camera does not have any selenium or other type of light meter, so either you guess the exposure using sunny 16 rule or use an external light meter.

Keep in mind that old soviet cameras are very delicate, do not forget to cock the shutter before you turn the speed dial. Shutter speed dial sits to the left of the shutter release, it is handled by pulling the knob and then turning it until the shosen shutter speed is pointed by the arrow. Shutter speeds available are: 1/500, 1/200, 1/100, 1/60, 1/40, 1/30, 1/20 and Z (which turns out to be Bulb mode).

_First commandment of soviet era cameras: I will not turn the speed knob before cocking the shutter_

On the top of the camera, there is also a cold shoe and the rewind lever and knob. As you can see from the pictures of the camera, the frame counter is located in the cocking knob, it is very simple but does its job the only drawback to this system is that you will have to remember to put it back to 0 when you finish a roll, or you won't know how many frames are left.

Framing with this camera is not an easy task. The rangefinder system is very primitive, liko those found on early Leica I, II and III. It is not a fast camera for street photography. If you take a look at the back of the camera, you will be able to see to viewfinder, this is because focusing and composing the shot are decoupled. This meaning that in order to compose the shot, you will need to focus from the left one and then composing from the right one. If you like street photography, I encourage you to zone focus, trying to use always small apertures to increase the focusing distance and thus the focus error.

Focusing lever isn't also, at least in my opinion, very user-friendly, the lever is small and the travel is correct at 180ยบ of rotation. In the lens is also the aperture ring, which in my industar 22 is small ring surrounding the lens. If your fingers are big, I would encourage you to try to buy the camera with another lens, like the Jupiter 8, with the aperture ring in the outer part of the lens, any other way, you will end up puting your fingers in the lens.

But this is not the only drawback of having the aprture ring like that. This lens is not threaded, so you won't be able to use any threaded filters. In my case, this camera came with a 36mm yellow filter which is  inserted in the lens, making impossible to the task of adjusting the aperture, so you will need to take the filter out between shots.

Charging a roll of film into this camera is a kick in the balls, the system is the same found on, again, ol Leica I, II and III models. The bottom part of the camera is dettached and the roll of film is introduced from there. Present rolls of film leader won't work with this camera, you will need to cut it a bit narrower, I made a 3D-printed tool to cut the roll leaders to fit in this camera. The good thing about only dettaching the bottom cover is that is less prone to light leaks.

_The lens cap, on the other hand, is very beautiful_

Jokes apart, all the previous said, although slow, I found the shooting experience to be quite interesting and funny. The Industar 22 lens is not the sharpest I have seen, but for the price, what else could you ask for.

the maindrawback I had with this camera is that the shutter coirtains are in very bad shape, as it can be appreciated from the sparkles seen in the pictures attached in this post.

As a conclusion, Zorki 1 is a very beautiful camera that will make you think again when framing and focusing every photo. The drawback it may have are counteracted with the pure of the photography purist process it involves.
