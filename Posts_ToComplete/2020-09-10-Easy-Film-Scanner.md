# EASY FILM SCANNER:

Nowadays, film photography faces several (retos). film and camera prices, easier development and very outdated film scanning methods. Since 2010 when I re-started to shoot film photography I have been very concerned about the issue of film scanning methods in a digital world. 

I think that the expenses of film photography for a person who wants to start from nothing, are rarely justifiable, in my opinion, it is true that a nice quality Canon AE-1 with a nifty fifty may be "cheap", but there are other expenses which I enumerate in the following lines that are, on the other hand, hardly justifiable.

* Film - In the latest years, shooting film has became something next to a luxury. It is true that some films like C200 or Colorplus 200 are yours for peanuts, but what if you want to try Acros 100 II, prepare around 12€ for 36 frames. the same happens for other colour films like Portra.

* Film Development - In Spain, it is fairly easy and not expensive to have your film developed (if it is a color film and not 120 format). In my case, my lab in trust, charges around 10€ for development + copies. If you want your film scanned (who does not..) then the prices rises for another 10€, if the film is monochrome prepare another 10€, because is not a common format nowadays.

* DIY Development - It is true that it is really easy to develope both color and monochrome film, but the for the price of the chemistry (for colour films), it is not worth it. Tetenal Kit costs 30€ for 1L and allows to develope around 12 rolls, almost 3€ per roll, plus the time you dedicate, the bottles you have to buy and that you won't get any copies, in my opinion you have more value by having it done for you.

* Film Scanning - It is also possible to do your own film scan, there exists several ways, the cheapest one is by using a light table and making pictures of the frames with a phone. it is also possible to do this in a more professional way, with a DSLR and a Macro lens (add the cost of that). If on the other hand you want to invest in a flatbed scanner, prepare at lest 200€ for a decent one.

In my experience, I tend to develope my monochrome film, and have it developed for the color one (with copies). I do scan my film with a Canoscan 9000F MarkII, which for social media like instagram or such is fairly good, but not for printing, for that task you will need much better quality, 1000€ quality (more or less).

## EASY FILM SCANNER

But latest years have brought some fresh ideas, for example the one that uses a DSLR with a macro lens and a light table. I think that for the price, this is the best choice for a beginner film photographer. With this project, I want to ease that process creating a scanning rig which automatically advances the film and takes the snapshot of each frame, this way, it will be possible to scan a roll in a few minutes.

### PROJECT MAIN OBJECTIVES:

* Create an affordable film scanner rig
* It must be made out of 3D printed parts + necessary electronics
* Parts must be designed and 3D printed in home for lower expenses (whenever possible)
* Picture quality must be high
* Operability must be easy and intuitive
* Film adavance must be automatic
* Camera must be operated automatically

### PROJECT STAGES:

* Preliminary design (sketch)
