# INTRODUCTION

Since a long time ago I have been longing to get a hassie-like camera. Evidently a Hasselblad 500cm is a bit out of my reach. 3 years ago I bought my girlfriend a beautiful Zneza Bronica S2. That is a bulky, sturdy beautiful 6x6 format camera. But i wanted something a bit more travel friendly. I think that this Bronica ETRS is still a heavy machine to carry around, nevertheless it is a bit smaller and hence usable.

On top of that, the fact that it is also a 6x4.5 negative you can squeeze a bit more you 120 films with 15 frames (12 on a 6x6), and I have heard that using a 220 film back you may get up to 17 frames, which I find it to be a good number.

# ZENZA BRONICA HISTORY:

Fill with some facts found on Wikipedia.

## EASY FILM SCANNER

But latest years have brought some fresh ideas, for example the one that uses a DSLR with a macro lens and a light table. I think that for the price, this is the best choice for a beginner film photographer. With this project, I want to ease that process creating a scanning rig which automatically advances the film and takes the snapshot of each frame, this way, it will be possible to scan a roll in a few minutes.

### PROJECT MAIN OBJECTIVES:

* Create an affordable film scanner rig
* It must be made out of 3D printed parts + necessary electronics
* Parts must be designed and 3D printed in home for lower expenses (whenever possible)
* Picture quality must be high
* Operability must be easy and intuitive
* Film adavance must be automatic
* Camera must be operated automatically

### PROJECT STAGES:

* Preliminary design (sketch)
