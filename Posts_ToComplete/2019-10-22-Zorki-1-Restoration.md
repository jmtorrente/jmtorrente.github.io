# ZORKI 1 RESTORATION PROJECT:

I have been a hobby photographer since the early 2000's. I started with a Nikon AF240SV which my grandparents bought me for when I received communion in 1998. It was a very neat and easy camera that introduced me into photography. I am so greatful to them for giving me that camera.

I made tons of pictures with that camera, mostly in Galicia, and some of them in school trips, I carried it to Ireland and also to many other places around Spain. It is a camaera with thousands of miles on it.

I did not have a digital camera until 2005, when my father, after several years of digital emergence, bought a fantastic Canon IXUS 500. A decent camera for its time, it was only 5MP and capable of capturing photos at four different resolutions and three compression levels, as well as 30-second clips of 640x480-pixel, 10-frame-per-second MJPEG video with sound. Video quality is not very good, not even for the time, some newer cameras were capable of recording VGA footage for longer time and at 15fps or even 30fps.

It was with the IXUS 500 when I started to edit my photos ans taking photography a bit more seriously. I started to make HDR pictures manually bracketing with that camera, the quality was not good, but at that time, I was very proud of them, I do not like those pictures now, but I keep them in my flickr since this is what I come from, I think it is a necessary reminder of the effort put through.
